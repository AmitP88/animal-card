			<p class="description">"You know what? I do not like being confined in the bowels of a military ship, or being fired upon by my enemies. And yet, I love crepes, and horses, and I certainly enjoy curling. You know, Canada may not be for everyone, but hell, I'm willing to give it a try.." -Master Shake</p>
